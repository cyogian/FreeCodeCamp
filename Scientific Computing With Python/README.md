# Introduction to the Scientific Computing with Python Projects
Time to put your Python skills to the test! By completing these projects, you will demonstrate that you have a good foundational knowledge of Python.

We are working to finish up the interactive Python instructional content. For now, here are some videos on the [freeCodeCamp.org](https://freeCodeCamp.org/learn) YouTube channel that will teach you everything you need to know to complete these projects:

- [Python for Everybody Video Course (14 hours)](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/python-for-everybody/)  
- [Learn Python Video Course (4 hours)](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-python-basics-in-depth-video-course/)  

In this section you will develop the following projects:  

- Arithmetic Formatter  
- Time Calculator  
- Budget App  
- Polygon Area Calculator  
- Probability Calculator  

Have fun!
